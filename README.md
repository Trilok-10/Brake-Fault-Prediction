# A Real-Time Explainable Hybrid AI Framework for Predictive Brake Fault Diagnosis With Multilingual Dashboard Alerts in Heavy Transport Vehicles
This is my Final Year project that i am working on and This project focuses on building an AI-driven system to predict and monitor vehicle brake faults in real time using machine learning. A Random Forest model is trained on processed brake sensor data to detect potential failures with high accuracy.

An interactive Streamlit dashboard is used to visualize brake health status and prediction results in real time. To improve transparency and trust in the model, Explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) are integrated to interpret feature contributions behind each prediction.

The system also includes a real-time data simulation pipeline and an automated alert mechanism that sends SMS and WhatsApp notifications when critical brake faults are detected. The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it scalable and suitable for real-world automotive fault diagnosis applications.
